// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "In this step developers reseaerch and anlayze the needs of end users. As well as gathering and defining any prototype the system requires. "
const design = "In this step devlopers outline the overall detials of  the applicaton: User interfraces, System interfaces, Network requirementsm, and Database"
const implementation = "This is the step when the software is the production environment and brings it into operation"
const testing = "This is the step when developers test and make sure there aren't any problems with the software and detect any bugs that needs to be fixed"
const maintain = "This is the step when developers modify and update software applications after delivery."
